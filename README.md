# latex-splaytree-cheatsheet

**latex-splaytree-cheatsheet** is a one page splay tree study guide
  for splay tree rotations.

This project is useful for students that are learning splay tree data
structures.  The balancing rotations can be printed on a single page.

The splay tree rotations are created using tikz, so this project may
also be of interest to those creating tree structure diagrams in
Latex using tikz.
